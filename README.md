## Ignition
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pivotalservices/ignition/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/pivotalservices/ignition/tree/master)

A landing page for developers to self-service their way onto your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment(s).

* Authenticates the user via OpenID Connect (which implicitly uses OAuth 2.0)
* Allows the user to access Apps Manager and view their personal PCF org

### Contribute

This application is a combination of a JavaScript single-page app (built with React) and a Go web app. The JavaScript app is built into a JavaScript bundle that the Go web app serves up. The Go web app also provides an API that the JavaScript app uses to function.

#### Yak Shaving (Developer Setup)

This project uses [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep) and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) for dependency management.

The following setup script shows how to get your MacOS workstation ready for `ignition` development. Don't just blindly execute shell scripts though; [take a thorough look through it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivotalservices/ignition/master/setup.sh) and then run the following:

> `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivotalservices/ignition/master/setup.sh | bash`

### Configure the application
#### Authentication
The app can be configured to authenticate against google or the PCF SSO tile.

To authenticate against google:
1. [Generate a google OAuth2 client id and secret](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
1. Ensure you have a username and password that can be used to connect to the
  Cloud Controller API for your target Cloud Foundry deployment
1. Set the following environment variables
  * IGNITION_AUTH_VARIANT="openid"
  * IGNITION_CLIENT_ID="[client id generated from google]"
  * IGNITION_CLIENT_SECRET="[client secret generated from google]"
  * IGNITION_AUTH_URL="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?prompt=consent"
  * IGNITION_TOKEN_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token"
  * IGNITION_JWKS_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"
  * IGNITION_ISSUER_URL="https://accounts.google.com"
  * IGNITION_AUTH_SCOPES="openid,email,profile"
  * IGNITION_AUTHORIZED_DOMAIN="@pivotal.io"
  * IGNITION_SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret-here"
  * IGNITION_UAA_URL="https://login.[system-domain]"
  * IGNITION_APPS_URL="https://apps.[system-domain]"
  * IGNITION_CCAPI_URL="https://api.[system-domain]"

  * IGNITION_CCAPI_CLIENT_SECRET=""
  * IGNITION_QUOTA_ID="your-quota-id-here"
  * IGNITION_UAA_ORIGIN="origin-here"

To authenticate against PCF SSO tile:
1. Configure the PCF SSO tile in your PCF foundation http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/
1. Create a PCF SSO service instance named `identity` in your space, and bind it to the ignition app
1. Set the following environment variables
  * IGNITION_AUTH_VARIANT: "p-identity"
  * IGNITION_ISSUER_URL: "https://ignition.uaa.[system-domain]/oauth/token"
  * IGNITION_AUTH_URL: "https://ignition.login.[system-domain]/oauth/authorize"
  * IGNITION_TOKEN_URL: "https://ignition.login.[system-domain]/oauth/token"
  * IGNITION_JWKS_URL: "https://ignition.login.[system-domain]/token_keys"
  * IGNITION_AUTH_SCOPES: "openid,profile,user_attributes"
  * IGNITION_AUTHORIZED_DOMAIN="@[your-domain]"
  * IGNITION_SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret-here"
  * IGNITION_UAA_URL="https://login.[system-domain]"
  * IGNITION_APPS_URL="https://apps.[system-domain]"
  * IGNITION_CCAPI_URL="https://api.[system-domain]"
  * IGNITION_CCAPI_USERNAME="your-robot-username-here"
  * IGNITION_CCAPI_PASSWORD="your-robot-password-here"
  * IGNITION_CCAPI_CLIENT_ID="cf"
  * IGNITION_CCAPI_CLIENT_SECRET=""
  * IGNITION_QUOTA_ID="your-quota-id-here"
  * IGNITION_UAA_ORIGIN="origin-here"
